# IAST-VMS

IAST-VMS (IAST-**V**ulnerability **M**anamgement **S**ystem) is a security testing
application, that help to find vulnerability during the end-to-end testing phase
of web applications. Therefore a specific agent can be downloaded in the application
that can be attached to the JVM of the application under test. The agents analyses 
the traffic that is generated by automatic or manual testers and reports incidents
to VMS. The application manges the vulnerabilities and has a gate mechanism 
that can be used to break build pipelines due to a specified quality specification.

## How to deploy
                                          
First of all you need to deploy the database management system with an appropriate 
database. You can use the _docker-compose_-File in the root directory to deploy the 
database (and you need a working docker environment). To bring the database up change 
the working directory of your console to the path of this project and call:
`docker-compose up -d db`

To deploy the **backend** just call `./gradlew bootRun` in the root project directory. 
If the backend is started, switch to the `frontend` directory.

You may need to install some dependencies before the frontend can be deployed. 
An important precondition is, that you have a working installation of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) in place. 

It is necessary to install vue-cli on your machine:
`npm install -g @vue/cli` 
To install the project dependencies run:
`npm install` in the context of the `frontend` directory.

To run the frontend type: `npm run serve` into your console and wait till the console 
tells you that the frontend is deployed. You can now access the application: [http://localhost:7080](http://localhost:7080)
