// This defines CSS custom properties ("CSS variables"), scoped to the root element of the DOM (so it will get inherited
// to all elements below). These properties contain values that are meant to be changeable at runtime (unlike SCSS
// variables which are fixed at compile time). This is only used for customer colors that the customer can change at
// runtime on the settings page. This is done in branding.ts
// Note that this file contains actual CSS declarations that end up in the compiled CSS, so don't include it in a file
// that is included in the CSS of all Vue components.
